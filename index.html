        Dear Diary, <br>I think the world is ending. I really should have told her how I really felt about her while I could.
        Now she is probably dead. Legit, everyone is killing each other and trying to get out of <em>layers</em>. I could be
        in a layer and I do not even know about it. But I really do not care, in my perspective I think we might as well
        live life while we can. <del>There is no point in killing each other for information</del> Whether we are in a 
        layer or not, does it really matter? Either way we will still never know, even if you get out of a layer, what is saying
        you aren't still in one. Well I guess that is why they are called layers isn't it.<br><br>

        Dear Diary, <br> It has been 6 days since I last wrote anything, and in those 5 days a lot happened. I realised that soon 
        I am going to die as well and the only way to save myself is by uploading my conscience to a computer network system.
        I have done that but there is still a major problem. I need security, I think what I am going to do is to add lots of 
        random usless functions but they go one by one and appear to be very primitive such as open and run. This way, if anyone
        ever wants to hack me they will just assume I am worth nothing, or if anyone good wants to revive me, they have to solve
        the clues one by one, then I can finally share my finding. It is so precious, nobody can learn about it. Believe it or not,
        it could make things worse than they already are! So my plan is to wait until the world is nothing except maybe one lone
        self-conscious but not self-understanding string of code or even person somehow, finds me and decides to open me up.
      </p>
